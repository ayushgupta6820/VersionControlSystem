# VersionControlSystem
 
Project Description: Bit By Git — A Custom Version Control System in C++ 🛠️📂

Bit By Git is a lightweight, efficient Version Control System (VCS) developed entirely in C++ 🖥️, designed to help developers track, manage, and collaborate on changes in their projects seamlessly. Inspired by popular tools like Git, Bit By Git focuses on simplicity, performance, and learning core version control concepts.

Key Features 🚀
Repository Initialization 📁
Quickly set up new repositories or initialize existing directories to begin tracking changes.

File Tracking & Snapshots 📑
Monitor and save the state of files over time, enabling easy rollback and history tracking.

Commit Management ✅
Record meaningful checkpoints with commit messages, timestamps, and unique identifiers.

Branching & Merging 🌿🔀
Support multiple branches for parallel development and merging capabilities to combine changes.

Conflict Detection ⚠️
Automatically detect merge conflicts and assist users in resolving them efficiently.

Optimized Metadata Storage 💾
Efficiently store commit histories, file versions, and branch info for fast access and minimal resource use.

Command-Line Interface (CLI) 🖱️
Intuitive CLI for executing commands like commit, branch, merge, and status with ease.

Why C++? 🧑‍💻
High Performance: Fast execution and low overhead, ideal for large projects.

Fine Control: Precise memory management for optimized resource usage.

Cross-Platform: Runs on multiple operating systems with consistent behavior.

Project Goals 🎯
Create a fully functional, educational VCS demonstrating core principles of version control.

Develop a modular, maintainable system using best practices in C++ programming.

Lay the foundation for future enhancements like collaborative workflows and graphical tools.
